# Daily Algorithms - Repository of Solutions
## How to participate: 

###  1/ Find a coding challenge / a coding problem 
The problem can be easy, intermediate, or difficult -- it doesn't matter. :) The challenge is to find some time to solve it.  

### 2/ Create a Github issue for it, if you don't already see it. 

The title of the issue should be in this format:
[Optional book/source] Problem title

e.g. [Advent of Code] Day 1: Chronal Calibration

e.g. [Cracking the Code Interview] Problem 1.1: Is Unique

e.g. [LeetCode] Add Two Numbers

The first comment in the issue should be the full problem itself.

### 3/ Paste a link to your solution (e.g. a link to your repl.it) and the full code as a reply in the issue thread.
